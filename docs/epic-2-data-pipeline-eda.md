# Epic 2: Data Pipeline & EDA

## Overview
**Epic ID:** 2
**Priority:** Critical Path
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (Foundation & Infrastructure)
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Status:** Blocked by Epic 1

## Epic Goal
Implement comprehensive data validation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data preprocessing pipeline for the C5 Quantum dataset. This epic establishes the data foundation and insights necessary for effective modeling in Epic 3.

## Business Value
- **Data Quality Assurance:** Ensures dataset integrity and identifies potential issues early
- **Pattern Discovery:** Reveals data patterns, bucket structures, and modeling insights
- **Baseline Establishment:** Creates performance baselines for least-20 predictions
- **Risk Mitigation:** Identifies data quality issues before expensive model training

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Dataset integrity validation passes for c5_Matrix_binary.csv
- ✅ Comprehensive EDA artifacts generated (JSON summaries, CSV tables, visualizations)
- ✅ Bucket clustering analysis completed with k=4,5,6 configurations
- ✅ Baseline least-20 predictions established for comparison
- ✅ Data preprocessing pipeline handles edge cases and validates constraints
- ✅ Performance benchmarks show <5 minute EDA execution time locally
