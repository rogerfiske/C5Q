## Resource Allocation & Timeline

### MVP Phase (Epics 1-5): 6-8 Weeks
```
Week 1-2:  Epic 1 (Foundation)
Week 3-4:  Epic 2 (Data Pipeline)
Week 5-7:  Epic 3 (Core Modeling)
Week 8:    Epic 4 (Deployment)
Week 9:    Epic 5 (Documentation)
```

### Post-MVP Phase (Optional): +7-10 Weeks
```
Week 10-13: Epic 6 (Advanced Models) - IF APPROVED
Week 14-19: Epic 7 (Production) - IF JUSTIFIED
```

## Critical Success Factors

### MVP Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Precision@20 >80% achieved
- ‚úÖ Windows 11 + RunPod deployment working
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive testing (>90% coverage)
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation and handoff
- ‚úÖ All technical constraints satisfied

### Risk Mitigation
- **Two model approaches** (NPL + Diffusion) reduce single-point-of-failure
- **Conservative MVP scope** focuses on proven architectures
- **Fallback strategies** (RunPod GPU for heavy training)
- **Comprehensive testing** catches issues early

## Decision Points

### Epic 6 Activation Decision (End of Epic 5)
**GO IF:**
- MVP performance consistently >80%
- Business stakeholders approve investment
- Technical team has 3-4 week capacity
- Advanced features provide clear business value

**NO-GO IF:**
- MVP performance meets business needs
- Resource constraints favor other priorities
- Implementation complexity too high
- Uncertain ROI for advanced features

### Epic 7 Activation Decision (End of Epic 6)
**GO IF:**
- Business scale demands production infrastructure
- SLA requirements justify complexity
- Operations team ready for production support
- Infrastructure investment approved

**NO-GO IF:**
- MVP deployment sufficient for current needs
- Managed services provide better ROI
- Infrastructure team capacity constraints
- Simpler deployment meets requirements

## Success Metrics & KPIs

### Technical Metrics
- **Precision@20:** >80% (MVP), >90% (Epic 6)
- **Training Time:** <1 hour (local), <30 min (GPU)
- **Test Coverage:** >90%
- **Container Performance:** <10% overhead

### Business Metrics
- **Development Velocity:** Epics delivered on schedule
- **Quality:** Zero critical bugs in production
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Positive handoff feedback
- **Operational Readiness:** Team can operate independently

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a clear path from MVP delivery to advanced production system:

1. **MVP Focus (Epics 1-5):** Deliver core business value with proven technologies
2. **Optional Enhancement (Epic 6):** Advanced models if justified by performance needs
3. **Future Production (Epic 7):** Enterprise-grade infrastructure when scale demands

The structure ensures immediate business value while providing clear pathways for future enhancement based on demonstrated success and business justification.
