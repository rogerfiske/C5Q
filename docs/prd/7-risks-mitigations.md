# 7. Risks & Mitigations

## Technical Risks
* **Overfitting to buckets:** Mitigate via crossâ€‘validation, regime splits, and ensemble diversity
* **False positives in least-20 predictions:** Implement cost-sensitive learning and calibrated thresholds
* **Long-range dependency modeling:** Leverage S4 models and structured state spaces for sequence memory
* **Model complexity vs. interpretability:** Balance advanced architectures with explainable bucket-level outputs

## Infrastructure Risks
* **Runtime limits on local machine (AMD Ryzen 9):**
  - Primary mitigation: RunPod NVIDIA H200 GPU fallback
  - Threshold: Tasks exceeding ~1 hour duration
  - Docker containerization ensures seamless environment transfer
* **Memory constraints with large context windows:**
  - Gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training
  - Sliding window approach with configurable context lengths
* **Storage limitations:** Dual SSD setup (Samsung 990 PRO + Kingston) provides adequate space

## Data Quality Risks
* **Dataset integrity violations:** Comprehensive validation pipeline with strict ascending/unique checks
* **Temporal drift in patterns:** Segmented analysis and regime change detection
* **Bucket instability:** Multiple clustering approaches (k=4,5,6) and manual override capabilities

## Deployment Risks
* **Environment reproducibility:** Docker containerization with locked dependencies
* **Hardware compatibility:** Multi-target builds (CPU/GPU) with automatic device detection
* **Model artifacts management:** Structured output directories with versioning support
