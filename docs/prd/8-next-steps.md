## 8.3 Cross-Epic Dependencies Matrix

| Epic | Depends On | Blocks | Critical Path |
|------|------------|--------|---------------|
| 1. Foundation | None | All others | ✅ Critical |
| 2. Data Pipeline | Epic 1 | Epic 3,4,5 | ✅ Critical |
| 3. Core Modeling | Epic 2 | Epic 4,5 | ✅ Critical |
| 4. Deployment | Epic 3 | Epic 5 | ✅ Critical |
| 5. Documentation | Epic 4 | Post-MVP | ✅ Critical |
| 6. Advanced Models | Epic 5 | Epic 7 | ⚪ Post-MVP |
| 7. Production | Epic 6 | Future | ⚪ Future |

## 8.4 Immediate Actions

* **PO Approval:** Validate epic structure and MVP scope definition
* **Epic Breakdown:** Create detailed user stories for Epic 1 (Foundation)
* **Resource Allocation:** Assign development team to critical path epics
* **Risk Mitigation:** Address testing framework and CI/CD pipeline setup first
* **Stakeholder Alignment:** Confirm MVP scope excludes advanced models (Epic 6+)
