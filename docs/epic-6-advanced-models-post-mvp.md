## Epic Stories

### Story 6.1: Inverted Transformer (iTransformer) Implementation
**Story Points:** 13
**Priority:** High (if activated)
**Dependencies:** Epic 5 + approval

**User Story:**
> As a **research scientist**, I want an **iTransformer model** so that I can **leverage state-of-the-art multivariate time series modeling**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Attention applied on inverted dimensions (channels as tokens)
- [ ] Enhanced multivariate correlation capture across 39 QStates
- [ ] Integration with existing bucket conditioning system
- [ ] Performance benchmarking against NPL baseline
- [ ] Memory and computational efficiency optimization

**Deferred Rationale:**
- Research-grade complexity exceeds MVP requirements
- Implementation uncertainty and dependency management complexity
- Performance improvement not guaranteed to justify development cost
- MVP models provide sufficient business value for initial deployment

### Story 6.2: Structured State Space (S4) Models
**Story Points:** 13
**Priority:** Medium (if activated)
**Dependencies:** Story 6.1

**User Story:**
> As a **performance engineer**, I want **S4 models** so that I can **handle long-range dependencies with superior computational efficiency**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] State-space equations implementation for sequence modeling
- [ ] Linear scaling with sequence length vs quadratic for attention
- [ ] Long-range dependency modeling (>1000 event context)
- [ ] 60× faster inference than standard transformers
- [ ] Integration with existing constraint and bucket systems

**Deferred Rationale:**
- Current dataset size (11,541 events) doesn't require long-range optimization
- Over-engineering for current problem scale and requirements
- Implementation complexity high with uncertain ROI for business case

### Story 6.3: Probabilistic DeepAR Integration
**Story Points:** 8
**Priority:** Medium (if activated)
