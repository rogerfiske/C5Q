# Epic 4: Deployment & Containerization

## Overview
**Epic ID:** 4
**Priority:** Critical Path
**Dependencies:** Epic 3 (Core Modeling)
**Duration:** 1 week
**Status:** Blocked by Epic 3

## Epic Goal
Package trained models into production-ready containers, implement deployment automation, and validate the complete pipeline from local development to RunPod GPU execution. This epic ensures the MVP can be deployed and operated reliably.

## Business Value
- **Operational Readiness:** Enables reliable deployment and operation of MVP models
- **Scalability:** Container-based deployment supports future scaling requirements
- **Reproducibility:** Ensures consistent execution across environments
- **Automation:** Reduces manual deployment effort and human error

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Docker containers successfully package trained models and dependencies
- ✅ Local-to-RunPod deployment workflow functions end-to-end
- ✅ Makefile automation enables one-command operations
- ✅ Container orchestration handles data persistence and artifact management
- ✅ Performance validation shows minimal containerization overhead
- ✅ Deployment documentation enables operations team handoff
